# rock-paper-scissors
The aim of this exercise is to write JS code for the rock-paper-scissors game that is going to be played in the console. It is the first project using JavaScript that I have to tackle on my own.
At a later stage, the code has to be adjusted and remade into game fully playable from the user's browser perspective. Additionally, the exercise includes revision of HTML and CSS tools needed to style the website.
